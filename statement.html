    <h1>The Shape of Sound</h1>
  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>
    A common theme in my artwork is to illustrate something that is normally “unseen” by the human eye.  In this project, The Shape of Sound, I focus on illustrating the shape of different sounds and songs into something more tangible for plain sight. I created these interactive illustrations using audio visualizers and analyze the data of the songs and sounds I have uploaded into the code.  In addition to that, I found that the audio visualizer reminded me of music players that I used as a kid.

  This initial idea was somewhat daunting, but once I learned how to code an audio visualizer it was quite simple. Having a better grasp on this skill made me want to push it further and see what I could make with just using audio visualizers. The process of creating an audio visualizer was very interesting such as seeing the mathematical data that made up a particular song. I created the site using the p5.js library and the p5.js.sound library. I originally wanted to incorporate some 3D models using three.js, however, the code wasn’t behaving correctly so I scrapped those parts eventually I would like to return to them at some point.
